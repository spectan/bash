# bash
My bash scripts, useful and useless.

- Main directory will be general use scripts, .bashrc, etc...
- bin directory will be more targeted for specific use cases. Directory on checkout will not be correct for immediate usage, refer to comments within scripts.
- bin/virtualbox is for administration of Vbox machines
